		<h2>About Reflections</h2>
		<!-- Abstract depth-of-concept section -->
		<p>
			Understanding of self begins from scattered fragments. Sharp, shallow reflections. However, through an intensity and focus of inner
			illumination, these pieces fuse into an annealed, seamless whole that transcends all separable shards.
		</p>
		<p>
			At first glance, we appear as a scatter of facets: trinkets glinting with the light of memory and feeling, each one seemingly distinct and
			touchable. Like fragments on a workbench, they can be held up, examined, admired. But alone, they remain brittle reflections—partial
			truths that shimmer but do not endure, to be merely glanced at but never gazed upon.
		</p>
		<p>
			When swept into the furnace of introspection, the facets begin to soften at their edges. Colors bleed and cracks melt away, and the pieces
			interact as their borders dissolve. They refract and shape each other’s internal tensions, forging new and unexpected contours and hues. A
			new shard introduced doesn’t merely add—it shifts the entire molten pool, altering the emergent whole in ways that cannot be untangled.
		</p>
		<p>
			The form crystalizes. The scattered, splintered self becomes an annealed, indivisible sculpture, and in this state no single facet can be
			teased apart without destroying the integrity of the whole. There exists now a lens through which one perceives oneself and the world with
			a depth and clarity impossible when clinging to individual pieces.

		<h2>Why Reflections Matters</h2>
		<p>
			Reflections is designed to help you explore every shard of your identity—your memories, your emotions, your truths—and to honor how they
			fit into the larger whole. Here you’re invited to cast each fragment into a virtual forge: choose a prompt that resonates, give it a tint
			that captures its mood, and lock it in place as part of your personal mosaic.
		</p>
		<p>
			As you gather and shape these shards, you’ll see patterns emerge—threads of clarity you might have overlooked. Each entry is both a mirror
			and a window: you gaze inward, and the app adapts to highlight what matters most to you.
		</p>

		<h2>How Reflections Works</h2>
		<p>
			When you create a shard, you select a guiding prompt (“spark”), enter your text, choose a tint, and toggle its glow. All of your shards
			form a cloud you can revisit, edit, or remove at any time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Soon, these shards will drive the generation of a 3D glass sculpture that symbolizes your journey. For now, each shard appears in a
			dynamic list; later, you’ll watch as they fuse into a seamless, interactive crystal you can rotate, examine, and even download for 3D
			printing.
